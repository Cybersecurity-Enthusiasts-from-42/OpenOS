# OpenOS - Advanced Research Kernel

OpenOS is a research-oriented, open-source operating system built from scratch for the x86 architecture. It features a **modular monolithic architecture**, complete exception handling, memory management, and timer support - a production-ready foundation for OS research and experimentation.

The goal is to build a small, understandable OS **from zero**, inspired by hobby OS projects like MyraOS, xv6, and OSDev examples — but implemented with **our own code**, fully documented, and open for community contribution.

##  Mission
To create a collaborative OS development environment where researchers, academics, and low-level system developers can explore:

- How CPUs boot an OS  
- What a kernel actually does  
- How memory, interrupts, and drivers work  
- How processes and syscalls operate  
- How filesystems and user programs work  

All with clean, simple, modern C + Assembly code in a **well-organized modular structure**.

##  Architecture

OpenOS follows a **modular monolithic kernel architecture**:

```
├── arch/x86/          # Architecture-specific code (IDT, ISR, PIC, exceptions)
├── kernel/            # Core kernel (initialization, panic handling)
├── kernel/cpu/        # CPU simulation (pipeline, single-cycle, performance)
├── memory/            # Memory management (PMM, VMM, heap, cache, bus)
├── drivers/           # Hardware drivers (console, keyboard, timer)
├── fs/                # File systems (VFS - future)
├── process/           # Process management (future)
├── benchmarks/        # Performance benchmarks and test programs
└── include/           # Common headers (types, multiboot)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Easy to navigate and understand
- ✅ Scalable for future growth
- ✅ Industry-standard organization

See [docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

### Build Bootable ISO

```bash
make iso
```

### Run in VirtualBox

```bash
make run-vbox
```

This automatically creates a VM, builds an ISO, and launches OpenOS in VirtualBox!

### Run CPU Architecture Benchmark

```bash
make benchmark
```

This runs a comprehensive benchmark comparing the 5-stage pipelined CPU against the single-cycle CPU model:

```

## 🛠️ Build & Run

### Prerequisites
To build and run OpenOS, you'll need:

- **gcc** with 32-bit support (or i686-elf-gcc cross-compiler)
- **nasm** (if you plan to extend the assembly code)
- **make**
- **qemu-system-i386** (for testing with QEMU)
- **grub-pc-bin**, **xorriso**, **mtools** (for creating bootable ISO)
- **VirtualBox** (optional, for running in VirtualBox)

#### Installing Prerequisites

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib nasm make qemu-system-x86 grub-pc-bin xorriso mtools
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S gcc nasm make qemu-system-x86 grub xorriso mtools
```

**macOS (with Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install i686-elf-gcc nasm make qemu grub xorriso mtools
```

### Building

From the project root directory:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the kernel and produce `Kernel2.0/openos.bin`.

### Running

#### Option 1: QEMU (Quick Testing)

To build and run the kernel in QEMU with direct kernel boot:

```bash
make run
```

This launches QEMU with the kernel. You should see:

```

Type on your keyboard and press Enter to interact with the shell!

##  Phase 0 Implementation Details

OpenOS Phase 0 includes complete implementations of:

- **Exception Handling** - All 32 x86 exceptions with detailed crash reports showing registers, error codes, and faulting addresses
- **Physical Memory Manager** - Bitmap-based allocator supporting up to 4GB RAM
- **Virtual Memory Manager** - Complete two-level paging with page tables, TLB management, and region mapping
- **Timer Driver** - PIT configured at 100 Hz for future scheduling
- **Enhanced Kernel** - Clean boot messages, progress indicators, and modular design

For complete implementation details, see [docs/roadmap/UPGRADE_PHASE0.md](docs/roadmap/UPGRADE_PHASE0.md).

##  Testing Exception Handling

Want to see the exception handler in action? Add this to kernel.c:

```c
void test_exception(void) {
    volatile int x = 1 / 0;  // Trigger divide-by-zero
}
```

You'll get a detailed crash report with full register dump!

#### Option 2: VirtualBox (Full Emulation)

To create a bootable ISO and run in VirtualBox:

```bash
make run-vbox
```

This will:
1. Build the kernel
2. Create a bootable ISO image with GRUB (`openos.iso`)
3. Create and configure a VirtualBox VM
4. Start the VM with the ISO attached

**Manual VirtualBox Setup:**

If you prefer to set up VirtualBox manually:

1. Create the ISO image:
   ```bash
   make iso
   ```

2. Create a new VirtualBox VM:
   - Name: OpenOS
   - Type: Other
   - Version: Other/Unknown
   - Memory: 512 MB (minimum)
   - No hard disk needed

3. Configure the VM:
   - System → Boot Order: CD-ROM first
   - System → Enable I/O APIC
   - Storage → Add IDE Controller
   - Storage → Attach `openos.iso` as CD-ROM

4. Start the VM and enjoy!

**Troubleshooting:** If you encounter any issues with VirtualBox, see the [VirtualBox Troubleshooting Guide](docs/virtualization/VIRTUALBOX_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

#### Option 3: ISO in QEMU

To test the ISO image in QEMU:

```bash
make run-iso
```

### Debugging with QEMU + GDB

OpenOS ships with a `make debug` target that starts QEMU paused with a GDB
server enabled so you can attach a debugger before any kernel code runs.

**Terminal 1 – start QEMU in debug mode:**

```bash
make debug
```

**Terminal 2 – attach GDB:**

```bash
make gdb
```

Then in GDB:

```
(gdb) continue       # resume kernel execution
(gdb) Ctrl+C         # interrupt to inspect state
(gdb) info registers # view CPU registers
```

For a full reference including QEMU logging (`make qemu-log`) and useful GDB
commands, see [docs/debugging.md](docs/debugging.md).

### Cleaning

To remove build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```
